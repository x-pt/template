## Development Setup

To set up the project for local development and start contributing:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Go `{{cookiecutter.go_version}}` or later (as defined in `go.mod`).
    *   `make` utility.
    *   `pre-commit` (Install with `pip install pre-commit` or `uv pip install pre-commit`).
    *   `golangci-lint` for linting (the CI installs it; for local use, see [golangci-lint installation](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/)).

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/{{cookiecutter.__gh_slug}}.git
    cd {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
    ```

3.  **Initialize the project:**
    This command will download Go module dependencies and set up pre-commit hooks.
    ```bash
    make init
    ```

4.  **Common development tasks:**
    *   **Format Go code:**
        ```bash
        make fmt
        ```
    *   **Check formatting (for CI):**
        This target is used in CI to ensure code is formatted.
        ```bash
        make fmt-check
        ```
    *   **Lint Go code:**
        Uses `golangci-lint`.
        ```bash
        make lint
        ```
    *   **Build the application binary:**
        The binary will be placed in `./bin/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}`.
        ```bash
        make build
        ```
    *   **Run tests:**
        Includes coverage reporting.
        ```bash
        make test
        ```
    *   **Run the application:**
        This executes the compiled application, which prints a welcome message.
        ```bash
        make run
        ```
        You can also run the binary directly after building: `./bin/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}} [args]`
    *   **Clean build artifacts:**
        Removes the `./bin` directory and Go build cache.
        ```bash
        make clean
        ```
    *   **View all available `make` targets:**
        Displays help for all Makefile targets.
        ```bash
        make help
        ```
