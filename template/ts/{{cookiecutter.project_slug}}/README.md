## Overview

`{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}` is a TypeScript project: {{cookiecutter.project_desc}}.
This template includes a default runnable application that prints a welcome message ("Hello, {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}! ..."). You can run it using `make run` after setting up the development environment.

## Features

- **Modern TypeScript**: Uses current TypeScript features and best practices.
- **PNPM & Biome**: Utilizes PNPM for package management and Biome for formatting/linting.
- **Makefile Automation**: Common tasks automated with `make`.
- **Ready for CI/CD**: Includes GitHub Actions workflows for CI, CD, and release processes.
- **Containerized**: Comes with a `Dockerfile` for easy containerization.

## Development Setup

To set up the project for local development and start contributing:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js `{{cookiecutter.node_version}}` or later (as defined in `package.json`).
    *   PNPM (e.g., version 9.x or as specified in CI - install via `npm install -g pnpm`).
    *   `make` utility.

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/{{cookiecutter.__gh_slug}}.git
    cd {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
    ```

3.  **Initialize the project:**
    This command will install dependencies using `pnpm` and set up Git hooks via Husky (as defined in `package.json`).
    ```bash
    make init
    ```

4.  **Common development tasks:**
    *   **Format TypeScript code (with Biome):**
        Applies formatting rules to the codebase.
        ```bash
        make fmt
        ```
    *   **Check formatting and linting (with Biome, for CI):**
        This target is used in CI to ensure code is formatted and linted.
        ```bash
        make fmt-check
        ```
    *   **Lint TypeScript code (with Biome, applies fixes):**
        Checks for code quality issues and applies safe fixes.
        ```bash
        make lint
        ```
    *   **Build the project (compile TS and package with NCC):**
        The output will be in the `dist` directory.
        ```bash
        make build
        ```
    *   **Run tests (with Jest):**
        Executes the test suite.
        ```bash
        make test
        ```
    *   **Run the application:**
        This executes the compiled application from the `dist` directory, which prints "Hello, {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}! ...".
        ```bash
        make run
        ```
        You can also run the compiled application directly after building: `node dist/index.js`
    *   **Clean build artifacts and dependencies:**
        Removes `node_modules`, `dist`, `lib`, and other build/test artifacts.
        ```bash
        make clean
        ```
    *   **View all available `make` targets:**
        Displays help for all Makefile targets.
        ```bash
        make help
        ```
