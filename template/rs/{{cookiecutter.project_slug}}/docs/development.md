## Setting Up the Development Environment

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Rust:** Install the latest stable version from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). This will provide `cargo`, `rustc`, and `rustfmt`.
*   **`make` utility:** Required to use the Makefile for common tasks. This is typically pre-installed on Linux and macOS. Windows users might need to install it (e.g., via Chocolatey, MSYS2, or WSL).
*   **`pre-commit`:** For managing Git hooks. Install via `pip install pre-commit` or `uv pip install pre-commit`. (Note: `make init` will set up the hooks as defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`).

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/{{cookiecutter.__gh_slug}}.git
    cd {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
    ```

2.  **Initialize the Project**:
    This command is crucial. It fetches Rust dependencies using `cargo fetch` and sets up pre-commit Git hooks as defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
    ```bash
    make init
    ```
    This step ensures your environment has the necessary dependencies downloaded and that code quality checks are run automatically before each commit.

## Code Formatting and Linting

To maintain code quality and consistency, we use `rustfmt` for formatting and `clippy` for linting. These tools are managed via `make` targets and pre-commit hooks.

-   **Format Rust code:**
    Uses `cargo fmt --all` to format your code according to the project's style guidelines.
    ```bash
    make fmt
    ```
-   **Check formatting (for CI):**
    Checks if the code is formatted correctly via `cargo fmt --all --check`. This is useful for CI pipelines.
    ```bash
    make fmt-check
    ```
-   **Lint Rust code:**
    Runs `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` to analyze your code for potential issues and enforce best practices.
    ```bash
    make lint
    ```
These checks (or a subset) are also enforced by pre-commit hooks installed via `make init`, which run on staged files before you commit.

## Building the Project

To build the project in release mode (optimized executable):

```bash
make build
```
This command runs `cargo build --release` and will generate an optimized executable in the `target/release/` directory. For debug builds, you can run `cargo build` directly.

## Running Tests

Tests are crucial to ensure the stability and correctness of the project. To run all tests:

```bash
make test
```
This command runs `cargo test`. The default template includes minimal tests, but you should add more to cover your project's functionality. Test files are typically located in the `tests/` directory or as module tests within your source files.

## Running the Application

To build (if necessary) and run the compiled application in release mode:

```bash
make run
```
The default application generated by this template prints "Hello, world!". You can modify `src/main.rs` to change this behavior.

## Other Development Commands

The `Makefile` provides several other useful targets:

-   **Generate Documentation:**
    Creates the documentation for your project and its dependencies.
    ```bash
    make doc
    ```
    The output will be in `target/doc/`.

-   **Clean Build Artifacts:**
    Removes the `target/` directory (which contains all build artifacts, caches, and documentation) and cleans up any Docker-related resources defined in `compose.yml`.
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

-   **Manage Docker Compose services (if defined in `compose.yml`):**
    ```bash
    make compose-up  # Start services in detached mode
    make compose-down # Stop and remove services
    ```

-   **Build Docker image:**
    Builds a Docker image for the application as defined in the `Dockerfile`.
    ```bash
    make image
    ```

-   **View All Makefile Targets:**
    Lists all available `make` commands with their descriptions.
    ```bash
    make help
    ```

## Project Structure

A brief overview of the project's directory structure:

-   `src/`: Contains the main application code (e.g., `main.rs`, `lib.rs`).
-   `tests/`: Contains integration tests.
-   `docs/`: Contains detailed documentation.
-   `target/`: Created by Cargo, contains build artifacts, dependencies, and documentation. (Ignored by Git).
-   `Cargo.toml`: The manifest file for Rust's package manager, Cargo. Defines project metadata, dependencies, etc.
-   `Makefile`: Defines common development tasks.
-   `README.md`: Overview and basic instructions.
