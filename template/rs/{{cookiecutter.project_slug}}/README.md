    git clone https://github.com/{{cookiecutter.__gh_slug}}.git
    cd {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
    ```

3.  **Initialize the project:**
    This command will download Rust dependencies (via `cargo fetch`) and set up pre-commit hooks.
    ```bash
    make init
    ```

4.  **Common development tasks:**
    *   **Format Rust code:**
        ```bash
        make fmt

    *   **Check formatting (for CI):**
        ```bash
        make fmt-check
        ```
    *   **Lint Rust code (with Clippy):**
        ```bash
        make lint
        ```
    *   **Build the project (release mode):**
        ```bash

        This executes the compiled application (which prints "Hello, world!").
        ```bash
        make run
        ```
    *   **Clean build artifacts:**
        ```bash
        make clean
        ```
    *   **Generate documentation:**
        ```bash
        make doc
