## Development Setup

To set up the project for local development:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`).
    *   Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit` (or `uv pip install pre-commit`).
{% if cookiecutter.cxx_build_tool == 'cmake' %}
    *   Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/).
{% else %}
    *   Install [XMake](https://xmake.io/#/guide/installation).
{% endif %}

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/{{cookiecutter.__gh_slug}}.git
    cd {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
    ```

3.  **Initialize the project:**
    This command will set up pre-commit hooks.
    ```bash
    make init
    ```

4.  **Common development tasks:**
    *   **Check formatting and linting (with pre-commit):**
        ```bash
        make lint-check
        ```
    *   **Build the project (executable and library):**
        This builds the main executable and `{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}_lib`.
        ```bash
        make build
        ```

        #### Building the Project Library

        This project also compiles `{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}_lib` as a library.
        During project generation (or by editing `cookiecutter.json` and re-running project generation scripts if you have them), you can choose the `library_type` to be `static` or `shared`.
        The compiled library will be located in the `build/lib/` directory (for CMake) or relevant XMake output paths.

    *   **Run tests:**
        This command builds (if not already built) and runs the GoogleTest executable (e.g., `./build/bin/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}-tests`). You can pass GoogleTest arguments via `ARGS`.
        ```bash
        make test
        make test ARGS="--gtest_filter=MyTestSuite.*"
        ```
    *   **Run the application:**
        By default, this prints "Hello, World!". You can also run it in server mode (if applicable to your app's logic): `make run ARGS="--mode server"`
        ```bash
        make run
        ```
    *   **Clean build artifacts:**
        ```bash
        make clean
        ```
    *   **View all available `make` targets:**
        ```bash
        make help
        ```
